# Research notes, 06/06/2022

- Work on Assemblage paper, finished introduction incl. constributions
  and reorganize sections to include measurement study and eval
  proper.

- Talked to Adya about webapp and fleshed out plan to merge that
  branch.

- Pushed initial Slog paper repository.

- Met with Yihao and Chang to discuss Assemblage measurement study

- Yihao has made good progress on fuzzing work--he shows results
  better than two existing pieces of work--zafl and afl-qemu
  (emulation). He shows we get much better throughput for things like
  bug finding and also path calculation. Looks that Yihao's tool just
  does plainly better for raw binaries than either of these tools,
  which is very promising. However, this is only one binary--we need
  to do this for many binaries and evaluate. He is using FuzzBench to
  allow a degree of standardization (FuzzBench made by others, not our
  tool)
